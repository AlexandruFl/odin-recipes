    <p>Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or breakfast meal prep. The buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy, and oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan pancake recipe can be easily customized by adding your favorite fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before cooking.</p>
        <ul>Here's what youre gonna need:
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>3 cups baking mix</li>
            <li>2 cups butter</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 tbsp of ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>Here's how you make them nice and good:
            <li>Preheat to 175C. Line a sheet pan (approx 13x18)</li>
